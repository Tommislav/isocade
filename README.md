isocade
=======

One (or a collection of? not yet decided) game(s) written for tablets 
(ios/android) which will use the ion iCade bluetooth arcade-game 
controller as primary input.

The ion iCade controller is connected over bluetooth and can be paired 
with any bluetooh-enabled device, and is by no means restricted to 
iPads.

The game(s) are written with Haxe and openFL.
Because of the cross platform nature of openFL, these games will be runnable on your local computers as well as 
in your iphone/android phone or tablet.

Since we happen to have two of these arcade controllers we will 
focus on games with local multiplayer support. The local server part is hosted in the same 
project.
